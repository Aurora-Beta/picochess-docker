Stand alone chess computer based on [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [DGT electronic chess board](http://www.dgtprojects.com/index.php/products/electronic-boards).

See [installation instructions](http://docs.picochess.org/en/latest/installation.html), [manual](http://docs.picochess.org), and [website](http://www.picochess.org).


This is an enhancement of the last main picochhess version 09N and includes changes of my version 1.0, 2.01 and 3.0

IMPORTANT:
This repositotry is only for code reference - it won't be a fully 3.0 version because of the github restrictions (25MB each file and less than 100 files in one folder) so don't expect to be able to use this repository as a working picochess version as a lot of (non source) fiels are missing for a working V3.
